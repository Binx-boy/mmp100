<H1>Welcome to my website</H1>
<p> My is Justin Sveri and I am a student in MMP 100. I am a 19 year old who is getting into 3D modeling and animation, I like to play games and watch movies and animations.</p>
<p> I likely won't use this in the future since this is for the sake of a project but hey who knows? Maybe I'll make this my main website. Click here for my youtube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqcPmJ6An798XqQZZyZYVcg">Click here for my youtube channel</a></p>
